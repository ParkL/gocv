# Roadmap

This is a list of all of the functionality areas within OpenCV, and OpenCV Contrib.

Any section listed with an "X" means that all of the relevant OpenCV functionality has been wrapped for use within GoCV.

Any area listed with "STARTED BUT INCOMPLETE" indicates that some work has been done, but not all functionality in that module has been completed. Your pull request would be greatly appreciated!
